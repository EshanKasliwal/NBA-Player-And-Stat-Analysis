If you are reading this, chances are you share my passion for National Basketball Association (NBA). I've consistently desired extensive information about my beloved players and teams throughout the years. This project is a data analysis of the NBA history seasonal data from 1995 to 2023. 

The dataset used includes seven parquet files, providing insights into NBA statistics from 1995 to 2023.
The data includes various statistics for players, teams, and seasons, such as points, rebounds, assists, efficiency, and more.

The Project aims to explore the data and find some interesting insights, such as:
- Exploring Player Demographics (Height and weight)
- Player Performance Analysis
- Top Performers in Playoffs (by points, rebounds and assists)
- Comparing regular-season and playoff performance for players
- Player Performace Trends Over Multiple Regular Season
- Analysing Player COnsistency in points, rebounds and assists.
